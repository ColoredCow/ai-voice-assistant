    "input": "Rhizobium and PSB used for biological seed treatment of soybeans are marketed by various companies. So how do you identify a good bacterial culture?",
    "output": "Preference should be given to purchase bacterial culture from Agricultural Universities, KVK if possible. Check the expiration date of the bacterial culture while purchasing. If the rhizobium and PSB in the market are available in powder form, the bag can be held upside down in the hand to see if it is good or not. After holding the bag upside down, the bacteria inside the compost bag itself. If it is stuck it should be considered good and if it falls completely then it should not be bought as it lacks moisture."

    "input": "What is PSB?",
    "output": "PSB stands for Phosphorus Solubilizing Bacteria. Legumes require more phosphorus. Phosphorus is present in our soil, but not in a form available to crops. PB works to make the phosphorus in the soil available to the crop in the form it needs. They are very useful for all crops, in all soils. Similarly, the chemical fertilizer applied for Phosphorus is only 15-20% effective. This means that only 15-20% of the chemical fertilizers we apply become available to the crops. And 80-85% is stabilized. PSBs work to provide stabilized phosphorus"

    "input": "If the seed treatment of bacterial fertilizers is to be done, will PSB, Rhizobium, Trichoderma be used in combination?",
    "output": "Since these are all organic fertilizers, it would be appropriate to use them together. But no chemical drugs should be mixed in it."
